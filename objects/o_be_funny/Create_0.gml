hi everybody

i'm aeon and heres the intro to comedy
in this course we will cover:
- cool shit you can do with gamemaker
- basics of programming
and nothing else.

this is in case you wanna pull something funny
like a minigame or some sort of logic

i don't know! up ta you.
included in the funnyzone are the folders for all of the asset types that are not immediately relevant to the textbox.
if you're interested, feel free to explore them. truthfully, i haven't found a use for some of these, but maybe you can.
the documentation is helpful.

anyway heres some simple stuff.
i'm an object! a gamemaker object!
this is the create event! it happens just once when the object spawns.
it's helpful for starting variables since you can set here and call/modify later
like,
*/
count = 0;
/*
theeeeres count. now the object (me) knows it exists, and we can modify it later.
like increasing it by one, every frame.
